# Motion Detector Using PIR Sensor

Automatic Room Lighting and Load Control System using PIR Sensor, NE555 Timer IC, BC547 Transistor, and Relay.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a hardware-based motion detection and automatic load control system designed using basic electronic components. It detects human motion using a PIR sensor and automatically switches ON a connected load such as a room light or fan. After a preset delay, the load switches OFF automatically when no further motion is detected.

This project was developed as part of the **Applied Electronics Assignment** for Semester IV.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The PIR sensor detects motion and outputs a HIGH signal.
2. The NE555 Timer IC, configured in monostable mode, generates a time-delayed output pulse.
3. The output of the 555 timer drives the BC547 transistor.
4. The transistor energizes the relay.
5. The relay switches ON the connected load.
6. After the preset time delay, the relay turns OFF automatically.
