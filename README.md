# Motion Detector/Smart Power Saver Using PIR Sensor

Automatic Room Lighting and Load Control System using **PIR Sensor, NE555 Timer IC, BC547 Transistor, and Relay**.

This project is a **hardware-based motion detection and automatic load control system** that detects human motion and automatically switches ON a connected load such as a room light or fan. After a preset delay, the load switches OFF automatically when no further motion is detected.

This project was developed as part of the **Applied Electronics Assignment** for **Semester IV**.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The **PIR sensor** detects human motion and outputs a signal.
2. This signal triggers the **NE555 Timer IC** configured in monostable mode.
3. The 555 timer produces a **HIGH output pulse** for a fixed duration.
4. The output drives the **BC547 transistor**.
5. The transistor energizes the **relay**.
6. The relay switches ON the connected load.
7. After the preset delay, the timer output goes LOW and the load turns OFF automatically.
